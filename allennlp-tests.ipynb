      "It is important to stress that the ECB 's mandate only extends so far . There are clear limits to what monetary policy can and should aim to achieve . We can not repair unsound budgets . We can not clean up struggling banks . We can not solve deep_rooted problems in the structure of Europe 's economies . Our monetary union was deliberately constructed so that these policies would be the preserve of elected governments in each Member State . Sharing a common currency would only be sustainable if each country assumed its own responsibility . This reflects the subsidiarity principle embedded in our European Treaties . And in that sense , it also echoes a central tenet of Catholic Social Doctrine . As Pope Pius XI wrote in 1931 , \" It is a fundamental principle that one should not withdraw from individuals and commit to the community what they can accomplish by their own enterprise and industry . \"\n",

      "In summary , Honourable Members , the European Council , in order to overcome the current crisis , established the need for all _ Member States and institutions _ to work with an agenda based on five pillars , with which you are already familiar , as they share the same structure as my Government 's own agenda . In other words : _ fiscal consolidation _ structural reforms at a national level _ structural reforms and market integration across the Union _ financial stability _ and , fifthly and lastly , what we might call \" more Europe \" . Only through simultaneous and consistent action on all fronts will we once again achieve sustainable growth and restore the stability of the European project .\n",

      "I will begin with the last of them , namely the need to strengthen the structure of the Union , or to put it another way , to construct more Europe . Today , as some of us have indicated on numerous occasions , the Eurozone has an incomplete architecture which has resulted in some of the problems we are now experiencing and the difficulty in finding solutions to them . The Heads of State and of Government therefore intensely debated the report \" Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union \" drawn up by Mr Van Rompuy , President of the European Council , in partnership with the Presidents of the Commission , of the Eurogroup and of the European Central Bank . This report raises the need to achieve further integration in four fields : financial , fiscal , economic and political .\n",

      "The members of the Euro have agreed that the European Stability Mechanism , the ESM , will be able to grant loans directly to those banking institutions which so require , without the need for the resources to be channelled via a State , once a single banking supervision mechanism has been established . We have also set a date for the European Council to examine these proposals through its urgent procedures : the end of 2012 . This is , in my opinion , a very important achievement . During this crisis the link of contagion between sovereign debt and the banks has proved particularly pernicious . Doubts as to the solvency of some banks have undermined the perceived soundness of various sovereign States , along with their ability to access the market . It was vital that this link be broken . Such assistance will be accompanied by financial and/or individual conditionality , depending on the State 's regulations for assistance . Only if the scale of the problem in the financial sector is too large with regard to the size of its economy will it be possible to impose more general conditionality . We have in this regard agreed to review the exceptional situation of Ireland .\n",

      "In my following remarks , I will address these two aspects of the recent experiences within the euro area . Second , the challenges that will have to be overcome in order to resolve the divergencies that have built up within the euro area . The current debate focuses on the differences in price competitiveness between EMU member states . However , in my view losses in competitiveness are not the root of the problem but rather a symptom of underlying unsustainable structural developments in some member states . Accordingly , the marked gains in price competitiveness the German economy has experienced have been a result of necessary structural reforms that were finally addressed in 2003 when domestic problems such as high structural unemployment , rising social security contributions and repeated excessive public deficits became more and more pressing . I will therefore take a closer look at this German experience trying to draw some conclusions for those countries that have lost competitiveness since the launch of the euro .\n",

The reason is that some of our largest export markets , such as Germany and Sweden , have not been so severely affected by the crisis until now . In the short term this somewhat cushions the impact of a deterioration of around 20 per cent in Denmark 's competitiveness over the last decade , measured by relative unit labour costs . We have lost and are still losing manufacturing jobs in the competitive sectors . If we want to boost employment in these areas , we must improve competitiveness _ there are no other options .\n",
